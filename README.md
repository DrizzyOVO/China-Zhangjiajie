This is a 3D moving parallax web. The movement of the mouse causes the images to move which creates a parallax effect. The downside of this is that it is made for tablet/pc size devices for a better experience.
I took inspiration from a yt channel and I'll mention the guy's Github profile here soon. 

He made a very cool website and don't wanna take his credit but in his web as soon as we zoom in/out we could see the images stacked one above the other, which creates a bad UX. (cause he used pixels to SIZE and PLACE the images.) 

CHANGES I MADE: I played with percentage. Depending on the size of the screen I sized the images accordingly. So zoom in/out no worries and maintains a better UX.
